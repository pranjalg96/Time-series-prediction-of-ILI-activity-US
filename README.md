# Time series prediction of ILI activity US
 Prediction of the ILI activity in the US in 2018-2019 season, using data from 2008-2009 to 2017-2018 season.

(I used google colab to run .ipynb, highly recommend)

one_state_regression_time_series_LSTM.ipynb: Used to train an LSTM model for a particular state, and
forecast and visualize its ILI activity. To run this code, first put the 'final_project.csv' file in the same folder as the code. 
Then open the code in an ipython notebook, and follow the cell instructions. 

categorical_time_series_LSTM.ipynb: Using classification rather than regression. Performs the same
function as one_state_regression_time_series_LSTM.ipynb 

all_states_regression_time_series_LSTM.ipynb: Used to train an LSTM model for all states, and
forecast and visualize their ILI activity. To run this code, first put the 'final_project.csv' file
into the same folder as the code. Then open the code in an ipython notebook, and follow the cell instructions.
